    <b>Overview</b>\n
    In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary  search  tree,
    and the first such data structure to be  invented.  In  an  AVL  tree  the
    heights of the two child subtrees of any  node  differ  by  at  most  one,
    therefore it  is  also  called  height-balanced.  Lookup,  insertion,  and
    deletion all take O(log n) time in  both  the  average  and  worst  cases.
    Additions and deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced  by  one  or
    more tree rotations.

    The AVL tree is named after its two  inventors,  G.M.  Adelson-Velsky  and
    E.M. Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper "An  algorithm  for  the
    organization of information."

    The balance factor of a node is the height of its right subtree minus  the
    height of its left subtree. A node with balance factor  1,  0,  or  -1  is
    considered balanced. A node with any other balance  factor  is  considered
    unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The balance factor is either
    stored directly at each node or computed from the heights of the subtrees.

    While AVL trees are theoretically  quite  sound,  they  are  not  commonly
    implemented due  to  their  high  implementation  complexity  to  keep  it
    balanced,  making  development  less  effective  when  compared  to  self-
    correcting tree structures,  such  as  splay  trees  or  heaps.  They  do,
    however, perform better than e.g. red-black trees. They are widely used in
    academic settings as an instructional data structure.

    <b>Operations</b>\n
    The basic operations of an AVL tree generally  involve  carrying  out  the
    same algorithms as would be carried out on  an  unbalanced  binary  search
    tree, but preceded or followed by  one  or  more  of  the  so-called  "AVL
    rotations."

    <b>Insertion</b>\n
    Insertion into an AVL tree may be carried out by inserting the given value
    into the tree as if it were an unbalanced binary  search  tree,  and  then
    retracing one's steps toward the root, rotating about any nodes which have
    become unbalanced during the insertion (see tree rotation). Since at  most
    1.5 times lg n nodes are retraced on the journey back  to  the  root,  and
    each AVL rotation takes constant time,  the  insertion  process  in  total
    takes O(log n) time.

    <b>Deletion</b>\n
    Deletion from an AVL tree may be carried out by rotating the  node  to  be
    deleted down into a leaf  node,  and  then  pruning  off  that  leaf  node
    directly. Since at most log n nodes are rotated during the  rotation  into
    the leaf, and each AVL rotation takes constant time, the deletion  process
    in total takes O(log n) time.

    Practically, this is a large overhead and complex to  program.  Therefore,
    it's more common to implement a lazy deletion -- leave the deletion target
    in place, flag it as "deleted", and replace it with an  inserted  node  if
    they would occupy the same spot.

    <b>Lookup</b>\n
    Lookup in an AVL tree is performed exactly  as  in  an  unbalanced  binary
    search tree, and thus takes O(log n) time, since an  AVL  tree  is  always
    kept balanced. No special provisions need to  be  taken,  and  the  tree's
    structure is not modified by lookups. (This is in contrast to  splay  tree
    lookups, which do modify their tree's structure.)

    <b>Usage</b>\n
    AVL trees are  faster than Red-Black  trees when lookups are more frequent
    than inserts/deletes and comparisons are expensive.
