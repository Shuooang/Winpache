//! Named read/write lock synchronization primitive
/*!
    Named read/write lock behaves as a simple read/write lock but could be shared between processes
    on the same machine.

    The fast lock is around 7% faster than the critical section when there is no contention, when
    used solely for mutual exclusion. It is also much smaller than the critical section.

    Thread-safe.
