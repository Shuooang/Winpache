//! Read/Write lock synchronization primitive
/*!
    An read/write lock allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations
    require exclusive access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but
    an exclusive lock is needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data,
    all other writers or readers will be blocked until the writer is finished writing.

    Thread-safe.
