/*!
    A file-lock provide shared and exclusive access to some resource based
    on the file locking functionality provided by OS. This means that multiple
    threads or processes can read the data in parallel but an exclusive lock
    is needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data,
    all other writers or readers will be blocked until the writer is finished
    writing.

    Thread-safe.
